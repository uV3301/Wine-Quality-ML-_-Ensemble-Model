# Wine Quality ML Ensemble Model
Given a data set about features and qualities that make a WINE </br>
The data consists of fields sucha as</br>
<ul>
    <li>pH value</li>
    <li>sulphate quantity</li>
    <li>citric acid concentration</li>
    etc.
</ul>
The target is a value or a measure of wine quality on a scale from <b>1-10</b></br>
We will try two approches: <br>
1. Support vector machine (SVMs) model as our classifier.<br>
2. A normal regression model.<br>
And then ensemble these model to improve our results<br>
<i>Plus</i>, We will be using grid search optimation to tune our hyperparameters for best results.</br>

# Get started
``` Start your jupter notebook and dig in```
```Alternatively review the code yourself and make your own python (py) file and run from CMD```
